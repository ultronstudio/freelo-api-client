# Unofficial client for Freelo

This library makes it easy to send requests towards [Freelo API](https://freelo.docs.apiary.io)


## Installation

The recommended way to install package is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Next, run the Composer command to install the latest stable version of package:

```bash
composer require xnekv03/freelo-api-client
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

You can then later update package using composer:

 ```bash
composer update
 ```
